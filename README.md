My solutions for Advent Of Code.

## 2021

The [2021](2021) directory contains my solutions for the year 2021 in ANSI C. 
At the time, I didn't know C very well, and it shows. All solutions pass 
valgrind without errors, but there are some unnecessary heap allocations and 
weird constructs here and there.

## 2022

The [2022](2022) directory contains my solutions for the year 2022 in the 
following languages, a different one per each day. I generated the list below 
by randomly shuffling a list of languages before this year's AoC began. This 
prevents me from choosing a language that would make the given task trivial.

I had to make a change, though. Originally, I had planned to solve day 11 in 
OCaml. After spending several hours trying to compile a piece of code that 
depended on the Base library, I gave up and rewrote the program in Haskell. 
When the user needs to install several complex build tools only to compile a 
simple hello world program, it's no wonder that OCaml is barely used. To keep 
the languages unique, I implemented day 20 in Java instead.
